651,DataSafe,9,241,Fiserv chose not to participate in this guide and as such we are not able to provide a description of DNA.
652,Community Charter,42,6991,"This phrase is the foundation of the Dollar Associates, LLC approach to field of membership consultation. We are convinced that the future of many credit unions is directly tied to the ability to diversify their product offerings and potential membership.    No one knows the process better for converting to a community charter than our team at Dollar Associates. Likewise, no one knows the questions you must be prepared to answer to make sure that you ""do it right"" when it comes to evaluating and applying for a FOM expansion.    Even though significant efforts have been made in recent years to streamline the rules and regulations pertaining to field of membership expansion requests, the process involved to convert to a community charter can, in many cases, become complex and cumbersome without clear direction and guidance. As shown in the chart below, the number of federal community charters approved has diminished greatly in recent years, indicating the complexity involved with gaining approval.    While the numbers have decreased in recent years, the benefit of adding potential members through a community charter continues to be a valuable diversification strategy for many credit unions, and we are here to make the process easier.    The Dollar Associates process in assisting our credit union clients in identifying potential field of membership expansion options begins with an initial consultation. This consultation allows us to strategize with you, your management team, and board to identify the field of membership opportunities available for your credit union. This initial consultation has proven to be invaluable for us and the credit union based on our experience in working with many credit unions considering field of membership expansion options.    During the consultation process, we generally do the following:            Discuss and evaluate current need for diversification          Review current field of membership as well as geographic area covered by the credit union          Discuss the current regulatory, statutory and political environment associated with field of membership expansions          Discuss and evaluate available options (community charter, underserved area expansion, TIP charter) in an effort to identify the best solution to your diversification needs          Review current financial condition of the credit union          Discuss the NCUA or state regulatory agency submission and approval process for field of membership expansions          Provide an overview of our services specific to the field of membership option best suited to your needs          Answer any questions staff may have regarding any of the available expansion options, process or our services    If you feel the strategic goals of your credit union could best be met by a community charter or other field of membership expansion, we would value the opportunity to discuss this matter with you."
653,TIP Charter,42,6991,"Relatively new to the credit union industry (Introduced in 2003), TIP charters allow single-sponsor credit unions to serve all employees in a specific trade, industry, or profession within a defined geographic area. The chart below reflects the growing nature of this charter type within the credit union industry.    Even though significant efforts have been made in recent years to streamline the rules and regulations pertaining to field of membership expansion requests, the relatively new process to convert to a TIP charter can, in many cases, become complex and cumbersome without clear direction and guidance. A number of key considerations must be taken into account whenever a credit union decides to pursue the option of a TIP charter.    Specifically, the credit union must be able to clearly establish and document three critical components in order to obtain a TIP charter from NCUA. First, the TIP to be served must be clearly and definitively identified, including any geographic limitations. Second, the credit union must be able to provide sufficient evidence to show it has the ability to serve the TIP. Third, the credit union must be able to demonstrate through a detailed business and marketing plan how it will serve the entire TIP. In addition to these legal requirements, there are also practical and political considerations that must be factored into any application to convert to a TIP charter."
654,Underserved Area,42,6991,"Following NCUA's recent rule change IRPS 08-2, underserved area adoptions remain a viable growth and diversification strategy for multiple common bond credit unions. Although the new rule raises additional hurdles for approval to serve an underserved area, the value in adding underserved areas to your charter are numerous.    The numbers clearly indicate that credit unions serving underserved areas have stronger growth rates than do the overall credit union community as a whole. Likewise, the ability to offer a lower cost financial alternative to the many pawn shops and check cashing outlets that seem to be on every street corner in an underserved area is an integral part of the credit union heartbeat.    In fact, documentation of service to persons of modest means is a growing credit union priority that can be enhanced by adopting underserved areas. Most credit union core processing systems can monitor new loans, account openings and services extended to residents of underserved areas through their addresses.    Equal in importance to the service and growth opportunities that come from adopting underserved areas, the ability to expand a credit union's outreach into an underserved neighborhood or community provides a membership diversification option that can help position the credit union to prosper for decades to come.    With over 90 million Americans living in underserved areas throughout the United States, many need a financial partner to assist them with their American Dream of financial self sufficiency. A pawn shop or check cashing outlet is not the partner they need.Underserved areas across America need the lower cost financial services that can be provided by credit unions. The doors are open if the vision is there to go through them."
